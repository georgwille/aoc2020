# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). They are neither meticulously tested nor polished, they were just working well enough for the purpose of the event. Some provide only part of the answer, and a bit of manual labor was required for the solution.
